# Challenge 3

## Javascript - Password Generator

This challenge required me to build a random password generator.  The generator prompts the user to select a length between 8 and 128 characters.  The user is also given the choices to have lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters in the password.  The character is told if they do not make a valid selection.  The password is then presented in the text-box to be copied by the user.
